   - Click the extension icon → Click **⚙️ Settings**

2. **Access the sample sheet**
   - Click the blue **"sample sheet"** link in the "Problem List Source" section
   - This will open: [Sample LeetCode Problem List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pGW3xFPvF4BU9hV5V2R_G9bLsm9nNlQzLKBCvuHzqKk/edit?usp=sharing)

3. **Make a copy**
   - Click **File → Make a copy**
   - This creates your own editable version

4. **Publish your copy to the web**
   - In your copy, click **File → Share → Publish to web**
   - Under "Link", select **Entire Document**
   - Under "Published content & settings", select **Comma-separated values (.csv)**
   - Click **Publish**
   - Copy the generated URL (it will look like `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-...`)

5. **Add URL to extension**
   - Paste the URL into the **Google Sheet URL** field in Settings
   - Click **💾 Save Settings**

6. **Load problems**
   - Click the extension icon
   - Click **🔄 Refresh List**
   - You should now see all problems from your sheet!

#### **Option B: Create Your Own Sheet**

1. **Create a new Google Sheet** with these exact column names (case-insensitive):

   | url | title | difficulty | topic | pattern | phase |
   |-----|-------|------------|-------|---------|-------|
   | <https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/> | Two Sum | Easy | Array | Basic Operations | PHASE 1 |
   | <https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/> | Add Two Numbers | Medium | Linked List | Traversal | PHASE 1 |

   **Required columns:**
   - `url`: Full LeetCode problem URL
   - `title`: Problem name
   - `difficulty`: Easy, Medium, or Hard
   - `topic`: Main topic (e.g., "Array", "Graph")
   - `pattern`: Specific pattern (e.g., "Two Pointers", "BFS")
   - `phase`: Learning phase (e.g., "PHASE 1", "PHASE 2")

2. **Follow steps 4-6 from Option A** to publish and connect your sheet

---

### **Step 2: Customize Your Settings**

#### **📚 Spaced Repetition Parameters**

Navigate to **Settings** to configure:

1. **Growth Factor** (how quickly intervals increase)
   - **Conservative (1.5x)**: Review more frequently — better retention
   - **Balanced (1.7x)**: Middle ground
   - **Aggressive (2.0x)**: Review less often — cover more problems faster

   *Example*: Problem intervals with 2.0x growth: 1 day → 2 days → 4 days → 8 days → 16 days

2. **Maximum Review Interval**
   - Longest time between reviews (default: 40 days)
   - Even mastered problems will be reviewed at least once every X days
   - *Recommended: 30-40 days*

3. **Starting Interval**
   - How soon you review after first solving (default: 1 day)
   - *1 day = review tomorrow (best for retention)*
   - *3 days = if you're very confident*

4. **Leech Threshold**
   - Number of "Low" confidence failures before marking as 🩸 Leech
   - *Recommended: 3-5 failures*

5. **Max Reviews Per Day**
   - Prevents overload by spreading reviews across days
   - *Recommended: 10-20 problems*

#### **⏱️ Time-Based Confidence Suggestions**

Set time thresholds (in minutes) for each difficulty level:

| Difficulty | Mastered | High | Medium | Low |
|------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Easy | < 5 min | < 15 min | < 30 min | 30+ min |
| Medium | < 10 min | < 25 min | < 45 min | 45+ min |
| Hard | < 20 min | < 40 min | < 60 min | 60+ min |

When you submit a problem, the extension will **auto-suggest** a confidence level based on how long you took!

#### **📅 Study Schedule**

- Check the days you want to study
- Reviews will only be scheduled on selected days
- ⚠️ Must select at least one day

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition Logic

### **How Confidence Levels Affect Scheduling**

| Confidence | Effect | Next Review |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Mastered** | ✅ Advance 1 stage | Longer interval |
| **High** | ✅ Advance 1 stage | Longer interval |
| **Medium** | ⏸️ Stay same or drop 1 stage | Similar/shorter interval |
| **Low** | ⬇️ Reset to stage 1 | Review sooner (1 day) |

### **Stage Progression Example**

Assuming **2.0x growth factor** and **1 day starting interval**:

| Stage | Interval | Total Days Since Start |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| 0 | New problem | 0 |
| 1 | 1 day | 1 |
| 2 | 2 days | 3 |
| 3 | 4 days | 7 |
| 4 | 8 days | 15 |
| 5 | 16 days | 31 |
| 6 | 32 days | 63 |
| 7 | 40 days (capped) | 103 |
| 8 | 40 days (capped) | 143 |

### **Leech System**

A problem becomes a **🩸 Leech** when:

- You've submitted "Low" confidence ≥ threshold times (default: 3)
- AND you're still below Stage 3

**Leech forgiveness**: After 3 consecutive "High" or "Mastered" submissions, the leech counter resets!

### **Smart Load Balancing**

When scheduling reviews, the extension:

1. Calculates the ideal review date based on SRS stage
2. Checks if that day already has too many reviews (> max per day)
3. If overloaded, shifts to the next available day
4. Only schedules on your selected study days

This prevents "review avalanches" and keeps your workload manageable!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **"No problems found" in popup**

**Solution**:

1. Check that your Google Sheet URL is set in Settings
2. Make sure you published the sheet as CSV (not HTML)
3. Click **🔄 Refresh List** in the popup
4. Check browser console for errors (`F12` → Console tab)

### **"Failed to fetch from Google Sheet" error**

**Causes**:

- Sheet URL is incorrect
- Sheet is not published to web
- Sheet columns are missing or misspelled
- Network connection issue

**Solution**:

1. Re-publish your Google Sheet to web as CSV
2. Copy the new URL
3. Update in Settings
4. Click Refresh List

### **Widget not showing on LeetCode**

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're on a problem page (`leetcode.com/problems/...`)
2. Refresh the LeetCode page
3. Check if the extension is loaded in `about:debugging`
4. Reload the extension

### **Emojis showing as boxes or question marks**

**Solution**:

1. Update Firefox to the latest version
2. The updated `popup.html` includes emoji font fixes
3. Clear browser cache and reload extension

### **Timer keeps resetting**

This happens when navigating between tabs on the same problem (e.g., Description → Solutions). This is intentional to prevent confusion.

**Workaround**: Stay on one tab while solving.

### **Reviews not scheduling on my study days**

**Check**:

1. Go to Settings → Study Schedule
2. Make sure at least one day is checked
3. If all days are unchecked, the extension defaults to all days
